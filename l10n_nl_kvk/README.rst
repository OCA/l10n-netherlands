This module integrates Odoo with the official Dutch chamber of commerce
`Kamer van Koophandel (KvK) API search <https://www.kvk.nl>`_.

The KvK API service allows lookups by the *Chamber Of Commerce Registration Number*
(KvK field) providing company name, street name, postcode and city. The lookups will be
triggered in the partner form views by entering a KvK field and pressing its lookup button.
The lookup works also on the company name field, providing Kvk number, street name, postcode
and city.

The KvK field is already provided by the OCA module `partner_coc`. That field is visible when
the partner is a Company (flag *is_company* = true).

More info about the lookup service here: https://developers.kvk.nl/documentation

Configuration
=============

Go to the General Settings panel under `KvK Integrations` and select one of the following:

* Kamer van Koophandel (TEST)
* Kamer van Koophandel (KvK API)

The first option can bu used for testing-only purposes and it's free. It allows the
lookup on a very limited list of companies. By default this is the service set
when the module is installed.

The second option allows to connect to the official KvK API search service.
Enter the API key that you requested from the `Kamer van Koophandel KvK API
<https://www.kvk.nl/producten-bestellen/koppeling-handelsregister/kvk-api/>`_.

Usage
=====

Create or edit a partner. If the flag Company is set, the KvK number field is displayed on the form.

If you enter a KvK number and click on the related button on the right,
the company name and its address fields are automatically filled.

If you enter a company name and click on the related button on the right,
the KvK number and the address fields are automatically filled.

In case the lookup returns more than one record, a popup will be displayed, allowing to select
one of the resulting records.
