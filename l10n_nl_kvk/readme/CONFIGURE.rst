Go to the General Settings panel under `KvK Integrations` and select one of the following:

* Kamer van Koophandel (TEST)
* Kamer van Koophandel (KvK API)

The first option can bu used for testing-only purposes and it's free. It allows the
lookup on a very limited list of companies. By default this is the service set
when the module is installed.

The second option allows to connect to the official KvK API search service.
Enter the API key that you requested from the `Kamer van Koophandel KvK API
<https://www.kvk.nl/producten-bestellen/koppeling-handelsregister/kvk-api/>`_.
