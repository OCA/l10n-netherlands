The Dutch Tax Services (Belastingdienst) require that the businesses maintain
their customer's data on their invoice documents for a specific amount of time.

This module goes through the invoices of a customer that is about to be
deleted, prints and attaches any reports that have been defined on the invoice
model so that they are available for the Belastingdienst.
