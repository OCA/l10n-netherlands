This module provides you with the Tax Statement in the Dutch format.

Use this module in combination with module ``l10n_nl_tax_invoice_basis`` if you want to adopt the *Factuurstelsel* system for your Company.

Installation
============

* This module depends on module ``date_range``.

Configuration
=============

This module makes use of the tax tags (eg.: 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a...) as prescribed by the Dutch tax laws.

If the default Odoo Dutch chart of accounts is installed (module ``l10n_nl``) then these tags are automatically present in the database.

If a non-standard chart of accounts is installed, you have to manually create the tax tags and properly set them into the tax definition.
The name of the tags must be formatted this way: "+1a (omzet)", "+1a (btw)", "-1a (omzet)", "-1a (btw)", "+2a (omzet)", "+2a (btw)", etc...

If your Company adopts the *Factuurstelsel* system for the accounting, also install the module ``l10n_nl_tax_invoice_basis``
(for more information about the installation and configuration of that module, check the README file).

The user must belong to the *Show Full Accounting Features* group, to be able to access the `Invoicing -> Configuration -> Accounting -> NL BTW Tags` menu.

Usage
=====

To create a statement you need to:

#. Verify that you have enough permits. You need to belong to the *Show Full Accounting Features* group.
#. Go to the menu: `Invoicing -> Reports > Taxes Balance > NL BTW Statement`
#. Create a statement, providing a name and specifying start date and end date
#. Press the Update button to calculate the report: the report lines will be displayed in the tab `Statement`
#. Manually enter the BTW amounts of lines '5d', '5e', '5f' (in Edit mode, click on the amount of the line to be able to change it)
#. Press the Post button to set the status of the statement to Posted; the statements set to this state cannot be modified

To add past undeclared invoices:

#. Open the tab `Past Undeclared Invoices`, available when the statement is in status Draft.
#. Set an initial date (field From Date) from which the past undeclared invoices will be displayed.
#. One by one, add the displayed undeclared invoices, by clicking on the `Add Invoice` button present in each line.
#. Press the Update button in order to recompute the statement lines.

Extra info about the workflow:

#. If you need to recalculate or modify or delete a statement already set to Posted status you need first to set it back to Draft status: press the button Reset to Draft
#. Instead, if you send the statement to the Tax Authority, you may want to avoid that the statement is set back to Draft: to avoid this, press the button Final. If you then confirm, it will be not possible to modify this Statement or reset it back to draft anymore.

Printing a PDF report:

#. If you need to print the report in PDF, open a statement form and click: `Print -> NL Tax Statement`

Multicompany fiscal unit:

#. According the Dutch Tax Authority, for all the companies belonging to a
   fiscal unit, it's possible to declare one single tax statement.
#. To create one tax statement for a fiscal unit, log in into the parent
   company and select the child companies in the statement (be sure the user
   belongs to the multicompany group).
#. The child companies must have the same Tax codes labels (Tax Tags) as the
   parent company, the same currency as the parent company and must be located
   in The Netherlands.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Exporting in SBR/XBLR format not yet available
* Limit invoices to last 5 year based on fiscal year end date (legal requirement)
* The unreported from date is calculate as 1 quarter, it should take 1 fiscal year based on fiscal year end date
