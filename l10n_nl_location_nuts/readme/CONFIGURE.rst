After installing the module, open the wizard:

Sales / Configuration / Contacts / Localization / Import NUTS 2013

and confirm.
This will update the NUTS regions with data stored in `RAMON <http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon>`__ (Reference And Management Of Nomenclatures)
and will link them with states already stored in Odoo.
