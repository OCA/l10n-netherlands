Auto-completion for Dutch addresses
===================================
This module contains integration of the excellent and free address completion
service 'PostcodeAPI', using the Python API library by Stefan Jansen (included
in this module). The service allows lookups by zip code and house number,
providing street name and city. The lookups will be triggered in the partner
form views when a zip code or house number is entered or modified. Only
Dutch addresses (which is assumed to include addresses with no country) are
auto-completed.

More info about the lookup service here: http://www.postcodeapi.nu/

Home of the Python API library: https://github.com/steffex/pyPostcode

Dependencies
============
This module depends on the module partner_street_number, which will split
up the street field into separate fields for street name and number.

Configuration
=============
Please enter the API key that you request from PostcodeAPI into the system
parameter 'l10n_nl_postcodeapi.apikey'

Provinces are autocompleted if a country state with the exact name is found in
the system. A CSV file with the Dutch provinces is included in the data
directory, but not loaded by default. You can import the file manually.

Compatibility
=============
This module is compatible with OpenERP 7.0.
