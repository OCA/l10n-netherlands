This module contains integration of the excellent address completion
service 'PostcodeAPI'. The service allows lookups by zip code and house number,
providing street name and city. The lookups will be triggered in the partner
form views when a zip code or house number is entered or modified. Only
Dutch addresses (which is assumed to include addresses with no country) are
auto-completed.
