This module extends the *Netherlands BTW Statement* module (BTW aangifte report), by adding the statement for the *Intra-Community transactions declaration* (ICP declaration).

The ICP declaration report is based on line *3b - Leveringen naar landen binnen de EU (omzet)* of the BTW aangifte report.
The period is also the same as the one selected in the BTW aangifte report.

This ICP declaration report includes:

* the VAT identification numbers of your customers;
* the total amount of intra-Community supplies from the Netherlands for every customer during the selected period.
