Configuration
=============

The exporting feature is available to the users who have Billing
Administrator or Accountant rights for accounting.

To configure the default start and end dates of the actual fiscal year,
go to accounting/settings and change the Last Day of the year you want
to export. Then in the form of the audit file export, by default the
end-date will be set accordingly and the start date will be 12 months
before the end date. Be aware that in case the OCA module
account_fiscal_year is installed, then the calculus of the fiscal year
dates is overridden, taking by default the date range defined for the
actual fiscal year (check Settings/Date Ranges).

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

-  be sure that you have Billing Administrator or Accountant rights for
   accounting
-  go to Invoicing/Reporting/Auditfile export
-  create a new record, adjust values if the defaults are not
   appropriate
-  click Generate auditfile
-  click Download on the field Auditfile

Known issues / Roadmap
======================
