Configuration
=============

The exporting feature is available to the users who have `Accountant` or `Adviser` rights for accounting.

To configure the default start and end dates of the actual fiscal year, go to `accounting`/`settings` and change the
last date of the year you want to export. Then in the form of the audit file export, by default the end-date will be set
accordingly and the start date will be 12 months before the end date.
Be aware that in case the OCA module `account_fiscal_year` is installed, then the calculus of the fiscal year dates is
overridden, taking by default the date range defined for the actual fiscal year (check `Settings`/`Date Ranges`).

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* be sure that you have `Accountant` or `Adviser` rights for accounting
* go to `Invoicing`/`Reports`/`Auditfile export`
* create a new record, adjust values if the defaults are not appropriate
* click `Generate auditfile`
* click `Download` on the field `Auditfile`

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* encrypted files would be nice
