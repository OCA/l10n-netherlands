This module extends the `l10n_nl_kvk` module adding the possibility to
integrate the *Kamer van Koophandel (OpenKvK) API* by
https://overheid.io/.

The OpenKvK API service allows lookups by the *Chamber Of Commerce Registration Number*
(KvK field) providing company name, street name, postcode and city. The lookups will be
triggered in the partner form views by entering a KvK field and pressing its lookup button.
The lookup works also on the company name field, providing Kvk number, street name, postcode
and city.

More info about the lookup service here: https://overheid.io/documentatie/openkvk
