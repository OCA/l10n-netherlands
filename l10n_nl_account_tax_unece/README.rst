=========================
L10n NL Account Tax UNECE
=========================

This module will auto-configure the values *UNECE Tax Type* and *UNECE Tax Category* on taxes that come from the *l10n_nl* module.

Both the values will also be set in the template of the tax accounts.
This will be useful in case of setting new companies with the Dutch chart of accounts in a multi-company environment.

Installation
============

This module will be installed automatically if modules ``l10n_nl`` and ``account_tax_unece`` are installed.

Usage
=====

#. Simply install the module to set the values *UNECE Tax Type* and *UNECE Tax Category* on existing taxes that come from the *l10n_nl* module.
#. If you create a new Dutch company and set its chart of accounts ( with the one that comes from *l10n_nl*), the newly created taxes will also get the values *UNECE Tax Type* and *UNECE Tax Category* set.
