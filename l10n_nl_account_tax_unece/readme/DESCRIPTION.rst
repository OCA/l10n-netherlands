This module will auto-configure the values *UNECE Tax Type* and *UNECE Tax Category* on taxes that come from the *l10n_nl* module.

Both the values will also be set in the template of the tax accounts.
This will be useful in case of setting new companies with the Dutch chart of accounts in a multi-company environment.
