==============================================
Intra-Community transactions declaration (ICP)
==============================================

Based on the OCA Intrastat framework, this module provides an
intra-Community Tax report (ICP declaration) for the Netherlands.
Only generating the required data for a manual declaration is supported.
Message communication with the tax authority has not yet been implemented.

The intrastat base module requires the country field required on
partner addresses. Selected countries are marked for inclusion in this report.

Amounts for products and services are reported separately. All services
are reported, regardless of the 'Accessory cost setting' which is used in
the French version of this report.

To exclude specific lines from the report, you can mark specific taxes
as such. If such a tax is applied to the line, the line will not be
included in the reported amounts.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Configure the country of your company (NL)

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Have invoices to some partners in other EU countries
#. Go to Invoicing - Financial Reports - Intrastat - ICP report
#. Create a report, define a date range, press Update
#. Watch the ICP report values for this date range appear
#. Manually copy the values into your ICP tax entry
