This module adds the BSN (Burgerservicenummer) field on partner forms.

The field is visible when the field ``company_type`` is set to ``Individual``.

A double check on the BSN is done when inserting/modifying its value:

- validation of the BSN (check whether the format is correct);
- check if another partner with the same BSN already exists.

In both cases, a non-blocking alert is shown.

Installation
============

The module depends on the external library ``python-stdnum``.

You can install that library by using pip3:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install python-stdnum

Configuration
=============

For security reasons the BSN number should be only visible to HR related roles.
Otherwise this will be in violation to the security framework of WBP regarding
the protection of persons info.

To be able to see the BSN number, give the proper permits to the user:

* User must belong to the "Employees Officer" group

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Open a form of a contact: flag Individual must be checked (flag "Company" must be unchecked)
* Enter a BSN number
