This module adds the BSN (Burgerservicenummer) field on partner forms.

The field is visible when the field ``company_type`` is set to ``Individual``.

A double check on the BSN is done when inserting/modifying its value:

- validation of the BSN (check whether the format is correct);
- check if another partner with the same BSN already exists.

In both cases, a non-blocking alert is shown.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

For security reasons the BSN number should be only visible to HR related roles.
Otherwise this will be in violation to the security framework of WBP regarding
the protection of persons info.

To be able to see the BSN number, give the proper permits to the user:

* User must belong at least to the "Officer : Manage all employees" group

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Open a form of a contact: flag Individual must be checked (flag "Company" must be unchecked)
* Enter a BSN number

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The 'ilike' search of a substring of a BSN number could not work properly in case the
  entered BSN number does not contain dots while the corresponding BSN number stored in the
  database contains dots.
