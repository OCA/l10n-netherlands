Use Dutch conventions for partner names:

-  have infixes
-  have initials
-  split first and last name (provided by partner_firstname)

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

The module relies on a list of known infixes to get the parsing right:

van, der, den, op, ter, de, v/d, d', 't, te

Also any combination, so *op den*, *van der* etc will also be
recognized.

If you need a different set of infixes, set system parameter
``l10n_nl_partner_name_infixes`` to a comma separated list like

infix1,infix2,etc

Note this replaces the above list.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  allow to turn on/off initials and infix separately
-  add nickname (roepnaam) field to also turn on and off separately
